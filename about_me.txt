Hello what is going on?
This is a new practice I did by myself to see if I could repeat the same steps.
Lets see what happens?

Now I am going to see what happens when I edit this doc another time. 
Will I be able to recreat the same steps I took just now when I made the doc?
I'll keep you posted.

Well I was able to do it! Thankfully! Let's hope I can do it again with
the a new txt as well.

Well I was able to make commits using two new-modified txt docs.
