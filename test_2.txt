7/20 

I made this new doc. Hopefully I can manipulate both of these and also commit
both at the same time. We shall see how this happens.

But note to self: if you want to add a new txt or code something new 
you must add that new html/css/txt doc to the folder that contains the 
cloned github repository!

I was able to write this new code and commit the changes to the repository! Cool!
